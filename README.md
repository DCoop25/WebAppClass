# Automation Testing 101
Automation Testing is the act of writing scripts that test a software. The scripts parse through a program, completing tasks that potential client would. In a perfect world, Automation Test would continually run allowing bugs in the software to be fund as soon as they are created.




## Benefits of Automation Testing

* Notices bugs before software touches the clientsbehavior that is typical of humans
* Easy to understand, presentable to people with no coding background

## Tools used

This is an example of the steps that an Automated Test will follow, it is in plain english. Each sentence has steps written in code linked to it. It's actually pretty interesting, and useful for find bugs as well as planning out workflows.
